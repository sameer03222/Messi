    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Lionel Messi is generally considered to be one of the best-ever footballers of the sport.
      He was born in Rosario, Argentina and exhibited unbelievable talent even at a very tender age. Despite facing
      health issues growing up, he battled through his will and love of the game. His journey through hurdles and his
      escape from humble beginnings in Rosario to becoming a global superstar has given hope to millions of fans around
      the world.
    </p>

    <p>The career of Messi gained momentum when he started playing for FC Barcelona, where he spent more than 20 years,
       becoming the clubs all-time leading goalscorer and winning numerous national and international titles. Messi has
       redefined dribbling, vision, creativity, and unmatched consistency, setting a new standard for what it means to be
       a complete footballer. Beyond Barcelona, he continued to shine with Paris Saint-Germain and later with Inter Miami,
       while also guiding Argentina to triumphs in the Copa América and the FIFA World Cup. His story is not just about
       trophies, but also about endurance, humility, and an enduring love for the beautiful game that continues to inspire
       generations.</p>
